REQ-6, REQ-7, and REQ-8 are indicated as addressed in the modified page files, but REQ-9 cannot be fully verified because no footer component change is present in the modified-files list (only the landing page view is evidenced).",

      "requirement": "Remove the “Donate here” section from the app’s footer area/landing view for now (remove the UI block showing “Donate here:” and the donation account id).",
      "reason": "The landing page file is modified and the summary states the donation section was removed there, but there is no code evidence in the diff summary that the footer component itself was updated. Since REQ-9 explicitly mentions the footer area/landing view, removal from the footer cannot be confirmed from the provided modified-files list.",
