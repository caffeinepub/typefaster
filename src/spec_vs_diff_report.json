  "summary": "REQ-2 (conditional time-bonus XP) appears to be implemented per the updated TypingChallenge description in the diff summary, but REQ-1 (fix createProfile authorization to avoid admin-only role assignment checks for normal users) cannot be confirmed from the truncated backend/main.mo changes; there is no visible evidence in the provided snippet that the role assignment path was changed as required. Some non-requested project metadata/summaries were also modified.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fix backend profile creation so a normal authenticated user can create a profile without triggering any admin-only role assignment checks; createProfile(username) should assign default #user for non-first users and #admin for the first user without calling any admin-protected role-assignment path.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet for backend/main.mo is truncated inside createProfile and does not show any change to role assignment logic or removal of an admin-only role-assignment call. No explicit evidence is provided that createProfile now assigns #user/#admin directly without invoking an admin-protected path.",
